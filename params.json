It means that you still missing something or you have still the opportunity to improve your model.\r\n \r\nThis R function help  you to generate different plot and you can save them into the pdf. Also this is test document. we draw the histrogram, boxplot. This function recolonize data type automatically and then it will plot corresponding plot.\r\n\r\n## following are arguments in R function  \r\nData_charcteristic it is function for ploting;\r\nvariable : It is variable name on which you need to plot \r\ndataIn : data frame object\r\nRespvaR : It is dependent/target  variable name ; default is null so plot will be based on full data and single color. color is specifies the distribution of target variable. target variable should be binary type.  \r\nsave_option : You can save the all plots either in pdf or jpeg/png formate.\r\nploting_path : Defult path is getwd() but you can set any path where you need to store the plots.\r\nDefult_idvars: It is those variable which are key variables like id, customer id; such variables are not useful in analysis.\r\n \r\n### Designer Templates\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
